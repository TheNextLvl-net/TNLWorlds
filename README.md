## Versions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The latest major version (2.0.0) changed the way how worlds and links are loaded<br/>
> When updating from any (1.x.x) version you'll have to import your worlds using the command
> `/world import <world> [<key>] [<dimension>] [<generator>]`<br/>
> To link your worlds again you have to use `/world link create <source> <destination>`

> [!NOTE]
> World images (`*.image`) do no longer exist, and you can safely delete all remanence of them<br/>
> The files `links.json` and `config.json` in `plugins/Worlds` also no longer exist and can be safely removed<br/>
> If you didn't change anything about the translations or presets, it is recommended to regenerate them by deleting the
> folders (`Worlds/translations` and `Worlds/presets`)
>
> **As with all major updates that introduce breaking changes, make sure to create backups before updating**<br/>
> If you encounter any issues after updating please report
> them [to us](https://github.com/TheNextLvl-net/worlds/issues/new/choose)
